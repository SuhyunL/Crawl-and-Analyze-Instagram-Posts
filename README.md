If you put a keyword '80s',
- 1990s: The most relatable word with the keyword (Seems like they tend to be considered as something similar)
- Music / Rock / Aesthetic : People seemed to think of the 80s as an artistic, memorable, and musical.
- Nostalgia, Recall, Longing : People consider 80s as the time full of aesthetics and music, so it's natural to miss it!
